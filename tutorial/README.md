# Tutorial
If you follow this step-by-step tutorial (or the [video series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiNTCIY7dw)) you should be able to re-create the app which is provided in this repository.

## Before you start...

For an optimal tutorial experience I recommend that
 1. you have mastered the [Django Tutorial Polls App](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/)
 1. you know your way around IDEs and editors (this tutorial is not about PyCharm, we only use it; any other editor - e.g. sublime text - should work fine too)
 1. you have a basic knowledge on how to use Linux Shell
 1. you know how to install packages on your system
 1. you are comfortable using [virtual environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) (you can probably work without them, but it is highly recommended to use them!)
 1. you know how to debug your web application in a Browser (we are using FireFox here, but any other Browser should work too)
 1. you can do basic programming tasks in JavaScript and Python (I recommend at least 3 months experience in both)
 
As a warning: This written tutorial is very superficial. I will however create a YouTube video about it, which I will link within this repository.
